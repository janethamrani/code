  <h3 class="title">Before you start reading...</h3>
  <p>Please remember that you can be as silly or serious as you want! If you want to write a random article about umbrellas, go for it! If you want to write about an experience you've had, go for it! You can be as flexible as you want!</p>
  <h3 class="title">Here are some ideas!</h3>
  <li>Post funny recent tweets</li>
  <li>Bucketlists!</li>
  <li>Recipes</li>
  <li>Write about an experience you've had</li>
  <li>Outfit/Hair/Makeup Inspiration</li>
  <li>Products you think people should try</li>
  <li>News (celebrities, politics, current events)</li>
  <li>A sale that's happening (Ex: Target is having a summer sale that you have to check out!)</li>
  <h3 class="title"><strong>Reminder</strong></h3>
  <p><strong>Please make sure that anything you write is not offensive to anyone. We will be reviewing all articles and if anything is deemed offensive, implicit, or inappropriate, you can be removed from our team.</strong></p>
